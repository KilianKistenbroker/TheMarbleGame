# The Marble Game

Welcome to The Marble Game project. This repository hosts the beginnings of a 2D platformer game engine, developed as a personal project during my first year at university for android devices. The primary goal behind this endeavor was to deepen my understanding of programming concepts through the lens of game development.

## Notable Features

The engine, though still a work in progress, includes a range of features:

- **Collision Detection**: Ensures accurate interactions between objects within the game world.
- **Scene Management**: Facilitates the smooth transition and management of different game scenes or levels.
- **Follow Camera**: A camera system that dynamically follows the player's movements.
- **Menu System**: An intuitive interface for navigating through game options.
- **Physics System**: Simulates realistic physical interactions between game entities.
- **Touch Controls**: Responsive touch input for mobile platforms.
- **Inventory System**: Manages items and equipment within the game.

## Current Status

As of now, I do not have plans to continue developing this project in the near future. It remains a valuable learning experience and a snapshot of my early programming journey.

## Usage

The code within this repository is available for anyone who finds it useful for their own projects, learning, or inspiration. Feel free to explore, modify, and incorporate any part of it into your work.
